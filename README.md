##About Me 
I am a current 1st year grad student in the Design and Technology program at Parsons. 

I am originally from Hershey, PA but lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years and San Diego last year. I have a background in biology and math and worked in a research lab following undergrad graduation. I took a year off from science and taught math and worked for a jewelry company. After taking a break from science, I realized I no longer wanted to pursue a pHD and applied to Parsons. 

###Things I'm interested in 
* Creative coding, some of the time 
* Game design and aesthetics 
* Creating interactive installations
* VR
